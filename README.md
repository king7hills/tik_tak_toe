TOP project creating a Tik Tak Toe game

Really learning the importance of git. I should have committed many times and instead kept tweaking my code to get things to work.
Moving forward, I must keep better git commits and records. I see it's value in this exercise.

Learned the hard way the importance of proper syntax.
IDs cannot have commas in them. Going forward, if I ever need to do something similar, I will use hyphens
and adjust my code accordingly. Ugh.
