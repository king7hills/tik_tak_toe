TOP project creating a Tik Tak Toe game

Really learning the importance of git. I should have committed many times and instead kept tweaking my code to get things to work.
Moving forward, I must keep better git commits and records. I see it's value in this exercise.

Learned the hard way the importance of proper syntax.
IDs cannot have commas in them. Going forward, if I ever need to do something similar, I will use hyphens
and adjust my code accordingly. Ugh.

Began by creating the game logic within the console. Then had to convert all game logic into a GUI based input system.
I originally created the gameplay module as a function. I then converted to have three modules initiated by clicking a
start game button. The button appears after each game and hides during gameplay.

Styling is geared towards mobile use, but works well on Desktop too.

INSTRUCTIONS:
To play on mobile, simply rotate your phone.

Player names are editable by clicking directly on the name.
Players may also choose their own color by clicking the color circle and selecting a new color.

Start a new game by clicking the Start Game button.
